<h1>WIC Central</h1>

	WIC safeguards the health of low-income women, infants, and children up to age 5 who are at 
	nutrition risk by providing nutritious foods to supplement diets, information on healthy eating, 
	and referrals to health care.

	This website was created by the National WIC Association (NWA) 
	which is the non-profit arm and advocacy voice of the WIC Program. 
	Our association members are WIC agencies, and we work with them to keep this websiteâ€™s information up to date.
